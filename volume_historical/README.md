# Volume Historical

Much like the Unusual Volume indicator, this volume indicator highlights several things:

* Highest volumes ever (green)
* Volume greater than 3x the 20-day SMA (yellow)
* Low volume under 50% of the 20-day SMA (red)
* Volume SMA with a slight mask applied (to help you focus on above average days)

All of these colors and measurements are configurable. Enjoy! ðŸ¤“
